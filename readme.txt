Websand for WordPress. Subscribe your WordPress site visitors in Websand with ease. 


== Description ==

#### Websand for WordPress

This plugin enables a simple widget that can be used to capture and send subscriber information to the fabulous and easy to use Email Marketing and Marketing Automation platform [Websand](http://www.websand.co.uk). 

The widget collects your site visitors' first name and email address and enforces an opt-in when they subscribe - keeping you in line with best practices. 

Behind the scenes you can configure the plugin to add a 'source code' for the signup. This allows you to monitor where your subscribers are coming from and allow you to assign the most appropriate welcome message for them when they subscribe. 

Unfourtunatly, this plugin isn't much use if you aren't a Websand user. Not to worry though, you can sign up and add some superpowers to your email marketing at http://beta.websandhq.com/


#### What is Websand?


== Installation ==

#### Installing the plugin
1. In your WordPress admin panel, go to *Plugins > New Plugin*, search for **Websand for WordPress** and click "*Install now*"
2. Alternatively, download the plugin and upload the contents of `websand-for-wordpress.zip` to your plugins directory, which usually is `/wp-content/plugins/`.
3. Activate the plugin
4. In your WordPress admin panel, go to *Appearance > Widgets* and drag the `Websand For Wordpress` widget into one of your theme's available widget areas. 
5. Set your Websand API token in the widget settings and configure where you would like your visitors to be redirected after they sign up, what source code you'd like to give subscribers from this widget in Websand and other customisations.


#### Looking for help?
Please take a look at the [Websand for WordPress knowledge base](HELPSCOUT_LINK) first. If you can't find your answer there, please look through the [Websand for WordPress plugin support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/websand-for-wordpress) or start your own topic.


#### Can I style the widget?
The Websand for WordPress widget comes with minimal default styling so it should blend straight in to your existing theme. If you would like to customise it however, the following CSS classes are available: 

`
.websand-for-wordpress-widget { ... } /* the widget form */
.websand-form-group { ... } /* form input groups */
.websand-for-wordpress-widget p { ... } /* form paragraphs */
.websand-for-wordpress-widget label { ... } /* labels */
.websand-for-wordpress-widget input { ... } /* input fields */
.websand-for-wordpress-widget input[type="checkbox"] { ... } /* checkboxes */
.websand-for-wordpress-widget input[type="submit"] { ... } /* submit button */
`

You can either customise your theme's stylesheets or use a plugin like [Simple Custom CSS](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-custom-css/) to use these classes and style your widget. 

#### Can I use multiple widgets with different source codes on my site?

Yes indeed! You can have multiple widgets with different source codes - just drag new widgets from the left column of the *Appearance > Widgets* page and add them to the theme areas on the right - each widget has it's own settings. To display the widget on specific pages, you can use the [Display Widgets plugin](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/display-widgets/).
